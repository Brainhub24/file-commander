File Commander
==============

Qt-based cross-platform Total Commander-like dual panel file manager for Windows, Mac and Linux with support for plugins.

**Building**

* Mac and Linux: open the project file in Qt Creator and build it. Compiler with C++ 11 support is required.
* Windows: you can build in Qt Creator or Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 is required (110 or 120 toolset). I have not tried building it with MinGW, but it should work if you enable C++ 11 support.
